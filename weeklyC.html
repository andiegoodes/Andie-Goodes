        <h2>Weekly C (2/1/2023)</h2>
        <p>I really enjoyed this week and doing the excersises assigned.</p>
        <p>I feel like I have gotten somewhat of a hang on trying different styles and formatting.</p>
        <p>I also really enjoyed learning and doing the css animation, I thought that was really fun and challenging to do.</p>
        <p>When doing excerise 1-hypertext- I had difficulty with formatting the button links, I was able to get my first button formatted and working when I hovered over it,</p>
        <p>but not the second button. I realized my formatting mistake and created an A ID using the style wrap. Although, I figured out how to apply the formatting to each button,</p>
        <p>I still had difficulty getting the second button to format correctly, turns out I had a spelling mistake that was preventing it to format.</p>
        <p>With excerise 2-poem variations- I really liked playing around with that, although I did have problems with using text alignment.</p>
