    <h1>Weekly G (03/24/2023)</h1>
    <P> I felt like this week was also a very difficult week motivation wise. I had a hard idea coming up for exercise 5, as well as for the final project.
    <p> I like learning java but it is confusing at times because there is so much going on that it can get overwhelming.</p>
    <p> I still do not fully know what I want to do for the final project but I am learnign towards redoing the hypertext excerise and including different p5 elements.</p>
    <p> Another idea I had was to redo the poem variation exercise and adding a little character mouthing the words but I think that is way too far out of my realm of possibilites.</p>
