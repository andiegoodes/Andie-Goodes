    <h1>Weekly A (01/2023)</h1>
    <p>
        This was my first week of ever doing any sort of coding. I was really intimidated to start, but once we got into it I felt like I was just stressing myself out.
        I know that there are harder codes that we will be doing but I think that it will be fine once we get into that.
        I did have a few issues on Wednesday about commiting my code to Github. When I tried commiting my code, there was another pop up "page" that showed that the page could not be submitted.
        I didn't know how to  get rid of it so I just logged out of the computer. On Friday the same issue occured when I tried to commit it, and I don't know exactly what I did to get rid of the pop up page but I resaved everything and ran the commit again and it worked. 
        I really enjoyed playing around with all the different formats for a webpage. I especially enjoyed figuring out how to include images and gifs.
