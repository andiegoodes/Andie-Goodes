        <p><sub>This week was kind of a struggle, I was sick on Wednesday and skipped class which made things a bit difficult.</sub></p>
        <p><Sup>I did really enjoy doing our research for project 1. It was cool to look up artists and see how their websites compare to other artists websites.</Sup></p>
        <p><b>I liked Samantha French's website and liked how she included the color palette that she uses in hre paintings, on her website. I think it brought the whole theme together really nicely.</b></p>
        <p><i>I also chose  Shantell Martin for her website. She had a very cool site that was interactive, and she used animations made from Javascript and it created a visual effect with the mouse which I enjoyed.</i></p>
        <p><em>Olivia Truong was the last artist I choose for their website. I thought their website was visually appealing in the way they used cards and animation to formate and break up their different sections. I also really liked the color palette that she used. </em></p>
        <p><em>Truong used complimentary colors on her website/cards in order to make each section stand out on its own.</em></p>
        <p>I think doing the research and trying out different styles, animations, and colors for this project will be very challenging, especially for me since this is a bigger scale project, but I feel like I will be able to be proud and feel accomplished by this project once it is done.</p>
