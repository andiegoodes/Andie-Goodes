        <h1>Weekly E (03/05/2023)</h1>

        I really enjoyed doing this project this week. I liked being able to make my own website in the way that I wanted. Even with my website being a bit bare bones, I enjoy a minimal website that is straight to the point.
        I did struggle with getting links to work as well as the slideshows for each class. I still have some confusion with settings DIVS and DIV classes and making them individual.
        I also had a lot of trouble pushing my pages to github, as well as uploading the link, so I  had to submit a compressed file instead. I still am struggling with trying to understand github.
        I know it will get better with time and practice, but it is just very frustrating not getting something right away. One part that I really enjoyed was including the gif header,
        I had a lot of fun creating it. 
        Starting javascript, my first impression was that this was really hard and it would be very difficult. But I am excited to learn how to draw while using code.
