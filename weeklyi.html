    <h1>Weekly I (04/14/2023)</h1>
    <p>
        Working on the final project, I am really excited to for it to be done. I am doing a hypertext and poem varitation.
    </p>
    <p>My idea was to take the poem, Alone by Edgar Alan Poe, and make it into a cityscape. I am using a handful of drawings that I uploaded and writing the poem in graffiti. Another one of my ideas that I am unsure about is making a custom cursor. I want to cursor to look like a spray paint can and when you click, the cursor changes to make it look like the cursor is actually doing the spraying.</p>
    <p>I am having a hard time with getting my images to over lap. I want the links to the next verses of the poem to be image links with exported pngs but I am having a hard time getting them into position.</p>
    <p>For two of the images I want to make them gifs, with traindoors closing and opening. I do not know how that will work or how the formatting will effect it at all. I am excited to finish this project and I cant wait to see how it turns out.</p>
