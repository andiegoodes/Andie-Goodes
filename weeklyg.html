    <h1>Weekly G (03/24/2023)</h1>
    <p>
        I felt like this week was a difficult one. Learning javascript intimidated me a lot, but after doing our "drawing with code" assignment, if was easier to get the hang of then I originally thought.
    </p>
    <p>I really enjoyed the "drawing with code", even tho I did a simple "optical illusion" I thought it was fun to get into.</p>
    <p>In my digital imaging class, we are also starting to learn how to draw images with javascript using p5. It is nice doing coding in both classes because if I do not get a certain concept in one class, I can try to get another explanation in the other.</p>
    <p>I am very excited to continue learning how to use javascript and I am even more excited to learn how to animate with the software.</p>
