        <h1>Weekly E (03/05/2023)</h1>
     
       <p> I was nervous to start javascript as I have heard that it is a bit confusing to get into.</p>
       <p>While getting into the homework assignment, I got frustratred quite a bit before I was able to actually get the hang of it.</p>
       <p>I think the p5 pgae is very helpful in trying new things and it explains the process of the functions very well.</p>
       <p>Finishing up the assignment, I really liked how it all turned out to be an abstract "illusion".</p>
       <p>I am excited to keep working with Javascript and how to do more complicated things in the future.</p>
